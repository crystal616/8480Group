# MovieLens Dataset
# This project constructs a contend-based movie recommendation system which can uncover potential audiences for a movie for the purpose of advertisement and can recommend movies to the customer based on his preference. The model we use is the KNN model. The Cosine similarity is used as the metric of distance between movies.  Movie popularity is also included in our model.
